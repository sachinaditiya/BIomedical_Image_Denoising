# BIomedical Image Denoising Using CBDNet and UNet

​Image denoising works are mostly inclined towards general images and not biomedical images.

​Newer algorithms are mostly implemented for general images.

​Current algorithms being used for biomedical image denoising are computationally expensive.

​So in this work we have used UNet Algorithm and CBDNet Algorithm for two biomedical image datasets and compared it's denoising performance and computation time by using certain metrics
